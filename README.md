# 🛠️ Embedded Systems Projects

Welcome to the embedded systems and Python integration repository! This collection includes Arduino `.ino` sketches and Python scripts focused on wireless communication, health monitoring, sensor interfacing, and automation.

---

## 📡 Wireless Communication

- **HC12_rx.ino**  
  Code for receiving data via the HC-12 wireless serial communication module.

- **HC12_tx.ino**  
  Code for transmitting data using the HC-12 module.

- **NRF24L01_WIRELESS_CMN.ino**  
  NRF24L01 wireless module communication demo between Arduino devices.

## 🔊 Audio & Signal Tests

- **SOUND_TEST.ino**  
  Tests sound sensors or speakers — useful for detecting sound events.

---

## 🧠 Sensor-Based Automation

- **esp_mpu_relay.ino**  
  Uses an ESP board with MPU6050 to control a relay — good for motion-triggered automation.

---

## 💉 Health Monitoring Projects

- **glucometer_excel.ino**  
  Reads data from a glucometer and logs it into an Excel-compatible format.

- **heart_lung.ino**  
  Monitors heart and lung activity using appropriate biosensors.

- **health monitor.py**  
  Python script for analyzing or visualizing health sensor data.

---

## 💳 Miscellaneous Projects

- **atm.py**  
  Simulates or interfaces with an ATM-like system. Could be used for smart card readers or payment terminals.

- **radar.ino**  
  Radar or ultrasonic sensing for distance or motion detection.

### 📌 Notes

- Arduino files (`.ino`) are meant to be uploaded via the Arduino IDE.
- Python files (`.py`) might require additional libraries such as `pandas`, `openpyxl`, or `matplotlib`.
